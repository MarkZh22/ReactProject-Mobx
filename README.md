Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

## npm start
Runs the app in development mode and starts the JSON server concurrently.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
The JSON server runs on http://localhost:3002 to provide mock API data.
The page will reload when you make changes to the code, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

## npm run dev
Launches the React app only, without starting the JSON server.

## npm run server
Starts the JSON server using src/server/db.json as the data source. The server runs on port 3002.

## npm run build
Builds the app for production and optimizes the output for the best performance. The build artifacts are stored in the build folder.

## npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode to run your tests.

## npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back. This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control over the configuration.
